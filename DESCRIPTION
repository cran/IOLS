Description: Addresses the 'log of zero' by developing a new family of 
    estimators called iterated Ordinary Least Squares. 
    This family nests standard approaches such as log-linear and 
    Poisson regressions, offers several computational advantages, 
    and corresponds to the correct way to perform the popular 
    log(Y + 1) transformation. For more details about how to use it, 
    see the notebook at: <https://www.davidbenatia.com/>.
